## Homework 5
### Topic: Searching/Sorting Algorithms

1. Write a modified version of selection sort algorithm that sorts an array of Strings and selects the largest element each time and movies it to the end of the array, rather than selecting the smallest element and moving it to the beginning.
2. Write a modified “dual” version of the selection sort algorithm that sorts an array
of integers and selects both the largest and smallest elements on each pass and moves each of them to the appropriate end of the array.
